    <p class="para">the term boba can, holistically, be in reference to the entire drink-plus-toppings, the most popular topping being tapioca pearls (which also happen to be called boba—I know, it’s confusing, but stay with me!). The drink as a whole is also known as bubble tea, pearl tea, and tapioca tea—depending on what part of the country you’re from. As stated earlier, the tapioca pearls that are also called “boba” are generally made from cassava starch, a root vegetable from South America that is also referred to as yuca.

    Boba—the drink in its entirety—originates from Taiwan, though its disputed which city and specific shop it actually started from. Originally, boba pearls were used in shaved ice desserts and paired with syrups, beans, and delectably chewy rice balls. Milk tea was also consumed regularly and thankfully, someone decided to merge the two, thus creating the genius, beloved drink we now have today.
    
    Boba culture made its way to America through Taiwanese neighborhoods and blossomed near college campuses and high schools, where students would gather for study groups. Most boba shops, even now, are open late and offer affordable snacks and drinks, which make them the perfect stop for late-night hang outs and studying.

    "Boba is technically tapioca pearls but also refers to the boba tea drink," said Matthew Wong of the New York City-based bubble tea store Tea and Milk. "The East Coast calls it bubble tea and the West Coast calls it boba tea."

    The tapioca pearls are made from tapioca or cassava starch (so they are gluten-free) and formed into small spheres. To sweetened them, they are often simmered in sugary syrup. From there, they can be added to a base, often a milk tea (tea combined with either powdered or fresh milk and sometimes a sugary syrup), but also green or black tea, coffee, a slushie, or a smoothie to become bubble tea.
    
    The pearls that end up in your drink can come in many sizes, though they're usually accompanied by a straw with an opening thick enough to suck 'em all up.

    "Quality boba should always have a nice chew to it," Wong said. "It should be soft but not too mushy where it just melts in your mouth."

    The flavor can vary based on the syrup the pearls are cooked in and the sweeteners added to the dough. Flavors can be anything from fruits to honey. The milk tea most boba pearls comes in are available in different flavors, too. Common ones include matcha, honeydew, strawberry, thai, and taro.

    One of the best things about boba? You can add it to tons of different drinks (including tea, milk tea, iced coffee or even slushies and smoothies). There are also a variety of flavors ranging from fruity options, like watermelon or grape, to ones that satisfy the dessert lovers, like chocolate or honey. Feeling adventurous? Try flavors like taro or lychee that are native to Asian countries. It’s like a vacation for your tastebuds.

    Tapioca (/ˌtæpiˈoʊkə/; Portuguese: [tapiˈɔkɐ]) is a starch extracted from the storage roots of the cassava plant (Manihot esculenta, also known as manioc), a species native to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil,[1] but whose use is now spread throughout South America. It is a perennial shrub adapted to the hot conditions of tropical lowlands. Cassava copes better with poor soils than many other food plants.

    Tapioca is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries. It provides only carbohydrate food value, and is low in protein, vitamins and minerals. In other countries, it is used as a thickening agent in various manufactured foods.
